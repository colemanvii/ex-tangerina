# Ex Tangerina

Ex Tangerina is a small cinema project.

It’s rooted in Southern place, human scale, and restraint.
The work favors stillness over spectacle and longevity over output.

This is not content production.
It’s a slow accumulation of films, images, and studies made when conditions are right.

Some things are public.
Most things are not.

Ex Tangerina means “out of the tangerine” —
what emerges from contact, not manufacture.
