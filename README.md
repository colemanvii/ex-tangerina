Ex Tangerina

Ex Tangerina is a small cinema project.

It works at human scale, with restraint and attention.
The work favors stillness over spectacle, duration over volume.

This is not content production.
It is a slow accumulation of films, images, and studies—made when conditions are right.

Some work is public. Most is not.

Ex Tangerina means “out of the tangerine”:
what emerges through contact rather than manufacture.
